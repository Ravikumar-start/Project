Strings:
===========

Strings are collection of words.

String is represented in double quaotes

String is combination of words, numbers, special characters.


String is a class aswell as a datatype.

String is also called as "immutable"

once you set the data then data can not be changed ideally.

there are multiple ways to declare a string:


1. String s="india";

2.String str=new String("inida")

3.StringBuffer bfr=new StringBuffer("india");
4.StringBuilder blder=new StringBuilder("india");

When we speak about string we must need to rememeber how the memeory management is happening on a string

on strings it is a very special case available in java

there are two kinds og memeory holders available called as Heap memory and Pool memory

this pool memeory is also called as "String constant pool" memory.



To manipulate the data of a string there are few methods associated withit

1.length:
this method is used to get the length of a given string.

input:string
return:int
synatx:string or string variable .length()


diff b/n length() and length

length()==mapped for string
length==mapped for arrays

2.charAt():
this method is used to get the character from a specifix index given by the user on the source string.


input:string
return:character

syntax:string or string variable .charAt(index)


3.substring():
this method is used to get the sequence of characters from a given source string

this method have 2 parameters 

1st param=== tell about the starting point, its an index value

2nd param=== tell about the length of characters

again length must be calucaled from the starting point of the  string
