Regular Expression:

Regular Expression is used to validate or extratct pattern based data.

When speak on pattern it is purel called as format.

For example, i need to validate my pan number is available in the below format.

My Pan Card Number Is HJIPM8500E


if you look properly , my pan number is available as 

Combination of Alphabets and Numerics.

The problem here is i need to validate if pan number is holding 5 alphabets follwed by 4 numeric and ending with an alphabet

Using the string methods,validating these formats is seriously a tedious process.
in order to over come this problems regex is introduced.


This regex will work in the following manner.

1.Rather than checking the character by character, it will search for only user given data format alone

2.To find teh data format, user must provide the pattern.

3.If the pattern is avialble, then only, the data extraction will be happen.

4.If no pattern is available, then data can not be extracted.



Learn Writting Patterns:
========================
1.Characters set==[]

[A-Z][a-z][0-9]-->And relation
[A-Za-z0-9]==>>any

2.Sequence of characters or length or pairs===>{size}

3.Include special characters===>>\\special character

4.include one more charcters except new line====>> *

5.include one more charcters include new line====>> .*

6.include spaces====>> \s

7.Only Numeric===>\d

8.Only Alphabets===>\D

9.not===>[^]
10.Starts-with===>^
11.Ends-with===>$


String builder and String buffer:

These two are called as mutable

we can change data directly without storing into a variable

String buffer is thread safe(Sync), where as String builder is not thread safe(Async).

For better performance String builder is the best.
