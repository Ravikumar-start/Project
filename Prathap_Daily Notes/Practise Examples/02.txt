Problem Statement:

When a user intput any value, check if the number is prime or not

Algorithm:

1.create a placeholder to get any input from the user
2. Prime number== one and its self divisble

it means that totaly it should get divisible 2 times

if a number divided more than 2 time, i conclude that it is not a prime.


Ex: if value =5


1,2,3,4,5


Steps:
1.create int variable and set to 0

2.When ever a number is getting reminder as zero , then increment the value

3.Once after completing all the numbers,then check if it is 2  or more than 2

4.Write a condition, if int value is 2, then prime, else not a prime
