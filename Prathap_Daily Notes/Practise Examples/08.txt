When i do my transaction on a finance application, i generally get a message like


	"My Transaction id (1089) is generated sucessfully"


from this message, can you pull the number available inside the parenthesis

condition: depends on the transaction type, the message and the number will be keep changing

but the representation of numeric will not be changed


1.Do not use any looping statemsnt and conditional statements
