How to consume other class properties?


Here properties reffered to variables and methods.

No matter where they are residing, if they are static call them by className

If they are instance type , then create an object then call them.

However it may differ when there is a inheritance applied.


Types of variables:

* Static variables
* instance variables
* local variables

Local Variables:
================
A variable which is created and intialized inside a method is called a local variable

the life time of this variable will be within this method only.

Note:When a variable is declared inside a method , but it is not intialized , when we try to consume that particular variable, compiler will throw an exception .

Static variables can not be a local type.


Static Or Instance Variables:
=============================

These variables are also called as "Global Level" variables

Variable which are declared inside a class but out side a method, called as "Global" variables.
