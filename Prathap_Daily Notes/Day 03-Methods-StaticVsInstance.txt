Methods:

Method is a block of code , where user will write business logic inside it, and used for the purpose of "reusability".


We genearlly make method to be dynamic in nature.

We must try to eleminate the hardcoded values.

it means that , a method must be in the position to accept the inputs from the user.

accepting inputs by a method is called as "Parameters"

Sending values to the method is called "Arguments"

from the above statement we confirmed that a method will accept a value, at the same time a method can also a return a value.


returning a avlue is nothing but, send some output back to the user.

method syntax with parameters:
===============================

accessModifier static/instance  returntype  methodName( datype param1,datype param2...datype paramN)
{

//business logic here

// if return value is required
return somevalue;
}


method name+parameters is called as signatures.


A function or method can be assigned to a variable ? 

Yes we can assign , only if the method is returning a value.


while we return a value from method , it should match to appropriate datatype

ex: when you try to return a int , the return type must be a int


Create  methods where you can do add, sub, div


Condition:
No Value must hardcoded, every method should return a value.


Static Vs instance:
==================

static and instance are both deal with a common term called memory.

it is all about memory management.


For all static items, class will be providing the memory.

so static items can be access through className
************************************************

For instance item, class will not provide the memory, so a object is used to create the memory.

when ever you create an object, a new memeory allocation will be happened, such that the peristance of the old value is very minimal.

so be cautious, when you want to store the value as an instance.

its good to check , if there is an object is created or not, if no object is created then create a new object, else use the existing old object only


How to create an object?

Object is called as an instance of a class.

Generally an object is created, to allocate memory to the instance level items either variable or methods.

An object can also hold static level items also.

this object can be created in two ways

	* Named Object
	* Nameless Object


Syntax:

ClassName refrenceVariable=new ClassName ();



new ClassName ();=============>>> Object
