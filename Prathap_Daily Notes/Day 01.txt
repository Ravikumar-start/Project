Day 01:Starting with java 

Java as a software is owned by sumnmicrosystems later quired by oracle.

This java as softwrae available in the format of "Free ware"

To use java in the application developement , we must need an account on the oracle and then only we can get the softwre


Min requirements:

4GB Ram preffer to have 8GB in place

Either >= win 7

Steps to download:

What you mean by JDK and JRE?

JDK is called as JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT

It helps the userr to build the application and also it helps the user to execute smoothly
JDK+JRE=JDK

JRE is the one which is used to execute only the programs
JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT


Java is a programming language, where it is binded up with set of rules and regulation and these rules will be controlled by the compiler called "JVM"

JVM stands for java virtual machine

The statement that what ever the developer wrote will scan by the JVM , and if these statements are aganist to the rules embarked in JVM, JVM will throw an exception we called it as Design time or compile time exception


this java as a software , provided a flexibilty to integrate with any kind of IDE like Eclipse,NetBean,Visual studio code,InteliJ

What do you mean by IDE:

integrated devlopment environment

These IDE provide a feature called "inteligence"

It helps the user to provide the proper syntax of the program.
if the user written the program againist to the rules of JVM, it warn the user then and there

This IDE is also provide a feature to intigrate with SCM like
Bitbucket,GITHUB,SVN merculi etc

SCM=Source Code Management


In currenet market , Eclipse and Intelij are in demand

Intelij has quite features
Debugging is little confusing in inteliJ when we compare to Eclipse

Intelij has feature where it can register the nvaigation of the files


This intelij is avilable in two formats

	* Community 
	* Commercial or enterprise

Eclipse is free ware every one can use it

For a begineer eclipse is the best option to start with


Eclipse is avialble as .exe installer file on the google

Navigate to my computer>>> properties>>>Advance System Settings>>environment variables

search for the variable called "PATH"

Click on edit

Press "End Key from the keyboard"

again reopen a new commandprompt and run the java -version



Once you see this output , go to download and install the eclipse ide

How to create a new project in Eclipse:

1.Go to file
2.Choose "New"-->other-->Java-->Java Project--Next
3.Enter the project name
4.Expand teh project
5.Navigate to SRC
6.Craete a package
7.Create a classFile

classfile is the placeholder for every developer to write the code
